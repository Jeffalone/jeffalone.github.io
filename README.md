## Hello 👁️🕳️👁️
I know that you thought this would be a normal landing page for my website, **nate**. I don't know maybe something along the lines of a little "Hello World!" site, but you are **sorely** mistaken. This is infact a landing page for your intervention. You see, it has been brought to _our_ attention that you have an unhealthy ~~liking~~ obsession with giant robots which needs to be addressed. Your friends are worried about you. The amount of content you consume with giant robots as main characters is becoming a problem. The first step to solving a problem is ***admiting you have one.*** When you are ready to talk we will be here for you to help you get past this _crippling addiction._
